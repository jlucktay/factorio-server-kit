> Running our own Factorio server on Google Cloud

Much like the game itself, this project aims to automate as much as possible.

## Usage

The project is primarily driven by Bash scripts, supported by Cloud Build pipelines and Terraform infrastructure-as-code.

### Bash scripts

- [roll-vm.sh](scripts/roll-vm.sh) - the main point of execution; will run up a GCE VM in the given location (see `--help`) with
    Docker containers for the Factorio server itself, as well as Grafana and Prometheus to tie into
    [Graftorio](https://github.com/afex/graftorio)

#### Library

Each of the above scripts taps into a common library of functionality under the [lib](lib/) directory.

### Cloud Build pipelines

### Terraform IaC
