> Running your own Factorio server on Google Cloud

Much like [the game] itself, this project aims to automate as much as possible, when it comes to running your own
Factorio server.

The scripts are based around the use of [preemptible VMs] which keeps running costs low.

## Installation

### Initial setup

1. Make sure the following tools are installed, available in your `$PATH`, and (where necessary) authorised:
    1. [Google Cloud SDK] - [quickstarts][gc-quick]
        1. [Installation][gc-inst]
        1. [Authorisation][gc-auth]
    1. [jq]
        1. [Installation][jq-inst]
    1. [Terraform]
        1. [Installation][tf-inst]
1. Get started on the [GCP Free Tier] and [create a new Google Cloud project][gc-project]
    - **Note: you are responsible for the running costs incurred by this project** beyond the limits of the Free Tier.
      Every effort has been made to optimise and minimise the costs of resource usage, and as of this writing running a
      server for ~50 hours a month cost less than ¬£5 in total, but this is an isolated example from a sample size of 1.
1. Set the `CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT` environment variable to the Google Cloud project ID
    1. For example: `export CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT=my-factorio-server-kit`
1. Run up the Terraform stack to provision infrastructure in GCP (implemented? -> ‚ùå/‚úÖ)
    1. Cloud Pub/Sub topic `cleanup-instances` ‚úÖ
    1. Cloud Scheduler job `cleanup-instances` to publish to topic ‚ùå
    1. Cloud Function `cleanup-instances` to clean up terminated instances, triggered by topic ‚úÖ
    1. Cloud Storage buckets
        1. `<project>-backup-saves` ‚ùå
        1. `<project>-saves-<location>` ‚úÖ
        1. `<project>-storage` ‚ùå
    1. Cloud DNS (optional)
        1. Managed zone ‚ùå
        1. Record set ‚ùå
1. Run the Cloud Build pipelines in order
    1. [Packer builder Docker image]
    1. [Factorio server VM image]

### As desired

1. Fire off the `roll-vm.sh` Bash script described below

## Usage

The project is primarily driven by Bash scripts, supported by Cloud Build pipelines and Terraform
infrastructure-as-code.

### Cloud Build pipelines

### Terraform IaC

### Bash scripts

- [roll-vm.sh] - the main point of execution; will run up a GCE VM hosting Docker containers for
    the Factorio server itself, as well as additional containers with Grafana and Prometheus that tie into [Graftorio]
  - the location/region that the VM will deploy to follows a default based on the [`locations.json` file], and can be
        overridden with a `--<location>` flag; see `roll-vm.sh --help` for more information
  - the [machine type] of the VM can be specified with the `--machine-type=...` flag
- [delete-vm.sh] - deletes any VMs currently running in the project, optionally filtering by name

#### Library

Each of the above scripts taps into a common library of functionality under the [lib](lib/) directory.

### Other notes

### Map (re)generation settings

The two settings files `map-settings.json` and `map-gen-settings.json` can be created from a map exchange string in the
game [as outlined here][map-settings].

## Upstream issues outstanding

- [Graftorio support for Factorio 0.18.x](https://github.com/afex/graftorio/pull/15)

## Related projects

### goppuku

[`goppuku`] is a small Go binary/service I built to have a server shut itself down
if the player count stays at zero for fifteen consecutive minutes.

The latest release of `goppuku` is installed in the Factorio server image by
[Packer's provisioner script].
